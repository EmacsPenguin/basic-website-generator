<h1>basic-website-generator</h1>

<p>A simple static website generator written in bash.</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>To use the website generator make a header.html and footer.html file. The header should include anything that you want to go above the text and the footer should include anything that you want to go below the text. Write the contents of your website in the markdown files, then run the script. That should generate a html file labeled <code>name-of-markdown-file.html</code>.</p>
